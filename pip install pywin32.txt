We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and itis not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of criticalfeatures, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined theoriginal examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance,the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convertdeclarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been testeddirectly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.
